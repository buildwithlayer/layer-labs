# Unlocking the Future of AI Integration: Five Takeaways From Our ‘MCP in the Wild’ Webinar

Our recent “MCP in the Wild” webinar—hosted by **Jonah Katz** (co-founder and CEO of [Layer](https://www.buildwithlayer.com)), joined by co-founder and CTO **Andrew Hamilton**, **Zeno Rocha** (founder of [Resend](https://resend.com)), and **Kenneth Auchenberg** (investor at [Alley Corp](https://alleycorp.com))—explored how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is changing the way developers and organizations build AI-driven experiences. Here are five core insights that emerged from the discussion.

## 1. MCP Moves You from “Developer Experience” to “Agent Experience”

> “Every little decision we made to improve DX actually helped AX.”  
> – _Zeno Rocha_ ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zenorocha/))

#### Key Insights:

- **Adopt a New Design Mindset.** Organizations like Resend are finding that straightforward APIs, clear documentation, and frictionless onboarding serve AI agents just as well as they serve human developers.
- **Strengthen Developer Foundations to Fuel Agent Adoption.** Building a robust developer experience (DX)—with well-structured endpoints and minimal friction—becomes invaluable when AI agents need to parse your APIs automatically.
- **Build Confidence Through Iteration.** As Zeno noted, even micro-level improvements in DX often _amplify_ an agent’s ability to orchestrate complex workflows. For a deep dive into bridging user and builder viewpoints, see Jonah’s blog about the [MCP Experience (MCPX)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-mcp-experience-matters-jonah-katz-0ityf/).

## 2. The Power of Workflows and “Vibe Flows”

> “It’s about building a quick loop: prompt, verify, see results. That’s what differentiates a good MCP server.”
> – _Andrew Hamilton_ ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-p-hamilton/))

#### Key Insights

- **Adopt a Prompt–Verify–Iterate Cycle.** A powerful MCP server lets AI tools (like ChatGPT or Claude) call APIs, propose actions, and verify changes in quick succession—creating a fluid developer or end-user experience.
- **Orchestrate Multi-Step Actions Seamlessly.** Real-world scenarios rarely involve single endpoints; think provisioning a database, configuring DNS, and sending emails. Layered steps and “vibe flows” make it all feel seamless.
- **Accelerate Developer Velocity.** Quick, automated feedback cycles keep developers (or end-users) focused on high-level creativity rather than manual tasks.

#### Dive deeper

For a lighter, fun take on orchestrating multi-step flows, check out Andrew blog, [“Building a VSCode Chat Extension to Order Me Cheeseburgers”](https://docs.buildwithlayer.com/blog/vscode_grubhub_extension), which shows how even a “frivolous” integration can illustrate valuable MCP patterns.

## 3. Distribution Is Everything—Especially for MCP

> “I would spend 30% of my time coding a library and 70% on docs and distribution. MCP is the same.”
> – _Zeno Rocha_

#### Key Insights

- **Spark Community-Driven Discovery.** While multiple MCP “registries” exist, effective adoption still hinges on helping developers—and AI agents—discover your MCP server in your docs or official channels.
- **Hone In on Your Target Audience.** For consumer or non-technical users, consider remote servers and OAuth-based flows. For developer-focused products, local servers with API tokens may suffice.
- **Leverage MCP to Drive the AI Funnel.** As Jonah notes in his piece on [AI Go-To-Market](https://docs.buildwithlayer.com/blog/ai_gtm), agents like GitHub Copilot and Cursor can bypass dashboards and docs entirely, making your MCP design crucial for attracting new adoption.

## 4. Security & Trust: A Work in Progress

> “Right now, you’re basically running untrusted code locally. That’s a huge challenge.”
> – _Kenneth Auchenberg_ ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/auchenberg/))

#### Key Insights

- **Guard Against Prompt Injection & Malicious Code.** Because AI agents can execute commands on your behalf, authentication and sandboxing are crucial. This concern arises frequently in early MCP builds.
- **Decide Between Local vs. Remote Servers.** Local servers are straightforward for developers but risky for novices who might blindly install untrusted code. Remote MCP servers with robust OAuth flows can mitigate risks for consumer-facing products.
- **Stay Ahead of an Evolving Protocol.** The community is working on improved authentication specs (like OAuth 2.1), containerized approaches, and consistent usage analytics.

## 5. The Business Case: Planting a Flag for the Future

> “We haven’t seen a direct revenue bump yet, but we want to be early to the party and ready when it takes off.”
> – _Zeno Rocha_

#### Key Insights

- **Position for Tomorrow’s AI Surge.** MCP might not immediately skyrocket your bottom line, but it’s a strategic investment as AI usage continues to surge.
- **Differentiate Your Product in a Crowded Market.** Having a robust, AI-accessible MCP server signals readiness. It’s not just a marketing stunt—it can unlock net-new users from chat-based IDEs and no-code AI builders.
- **Embrace Agentic Workflows as Your New Funnel.** Once you pave a frictionless path for AI to act on your platform, entire processes can happen without manual intervention—expanding who finds and adopts your product.

## Final Thoughts

For all the buzz, MCP is still in its early days. Its potential lies in enabling AI-driven agent workflows that transcend typical human user interfaces. As Zeno noted, the more you reduce friction for developers, the better you empower AI agents to do meaningful work.

If you’re looking to reduce friction—whether for customers, developers, or “agentic” integrations—MCP can be a game-changer. Expect deeper integrations, improved security models, and a wave of new “vibe flows” that elevate experiences from marketing demos to production-ready pipelines.
